# NEW-DO-IT-App
This minimal one page To-Do List app is made with Recycler View, Card View, and uses
the SQLite database to store the tasks. There is a save, edit and delete feature on the app.
Unlike the other repository which is in beta version, this app is fully functional and doesn't have any bug.
The Drawables and the material themes need some changes.
